# IBOT DIY Robot – MindPlus Extension (offline mode)

![](./arduinoC/_images/featured.png)

This project is an extension for the Mind+ application that gathers all the functions of the kit into a single set of commands, which would otherwise require multiple add-ons to work.

## What is the IBOT Robot

The IBOT DIY is a robot that is 3D printed and then assembled. Apart from the plastic parts (printed), the following components are required to assemble the robot:

* 1 × Arduino Nano

* 2 × small motors (MX1508 type)

* 1 x buzzer

* 1 x LED

* 1 × distance sensor (HC-SR04 type)


IBOT can be programmed directly from the Arduino IDE as well as from the Otto Blockly application, which is available for free on the above website. The Linux version of the application is a few releases behind the Windows version. 

I created this Mind+ extension, which imports the above library and enables programming the robot directly from the Mind+ application.
